description <- \"In collaboration with Texas Adult Protective Services (APS) and one of the largest mobile healthcare providers in North Texas — MedStar Mobile Healthcare (MedStar) — our team developed and piloted an EA screening tool: Detection of Elder Abuse Through Emergency Care Technicians (DETECT). The DETECT tool was designed specifically to help medics identify potential EA among community-dwelling older adults during an emergency response. DETECT relies entirely on the medics’ systematic observations of the older adults’ physical and social environment — no direct questioning of the older adult or their caregivers is involved. The intent was to create an EA screening tool that was easy for medics to use in the field and that helped medics capture information about older adults, their environments, and their caregivers that is thought to be associated with the occurrence of EA. 
We pilot tested using the DETECT screening tool with medics in the field between September 17th and October 26th, 2015. During the pilot test, MedStar’s Electronic Patient Care Reporting system (ePCR) was programmed to automatically prompt all medics to complete an EA screening using the DETECT tool while on an eligible 911 response. An eligible 911 response was defined as a call for a community-dwelling patient who was 65 years of age or older, the setting was the patient’s residence, and the patient resided in the community (e.g., private home, unlicensed adult foster homes, unlicensed board and care homes, etc.). Other types of residences (e.g., licensed skilled nursing facilities) were excluded because reports of EA in these settings are generally not investigated by APS in Texas. By definition, older adults who participated in the pilot study had to live in MedStar’s service area of an estimated (978,000 residents), which included Fort Worth, Texas, and 14 surrounding communities.\"
